# Python

***[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))*** - a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It emphasizes code readability with its clean syntax and is known for its versatility. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It’s widely used in web development, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.

## Characteristics
- Easy to read and write, with an emphasis on simplicity.
- Dynamically typed, reducing the need for explicit variable declarations.
- Extensive standard library, providing tools for various tasks out of the box.
- Interpreted language, enabling interactive testing and quick prototyping.
- Supports multiple programming paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, and functional.
- Automatic memory management (garbage collection).
- Large and active community, with extensive libraries and frameworks available (e.g. Django, Flask, Pandas).
- Cross-platform compatibility—runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other systems.
- Ideal for scripting, automation, web development, and data science.
