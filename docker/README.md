# Docker

***[Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software))*** - an open-source platform launched in 2013 that enables developers to automate the deployment and management of applications within lightweight, portable containers. Docker containers package an application and its dependencies in a standardized unit, ensuring that the app runs the same way across different environments, whether it's on a developer's machine, in testing, or in production.

## Characteristics
- **Containerization:** Encapsulates applications and their dependencies in containers, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.
- **Lightweight:** Containers are more efficient and lightweight than virtual machines since they share the host operating system's kernel.
- **Portable:** Applications run the same on any Docker-enabled system, from local development to cloud environments.
- **Isolation:** Containers run in isolated environments, preventing conflicts between dependencies or apps.
- **Fast Deployment:** Containers start up quickly compared to traditional virtual machines.
- **Scalability:** Simplifies scaling applications across multiple environments or cloud platforms.
- **Image-based:** Applications are built from reusable, versioned images, which can be stored and shared via Docker Hub or private registries.
- **Support for microservices:** Ideal for building and deploying microservices architectures, with each service running in its own container.
- **Broad ecosystem:** Integrates well with DevOps tools, CI/CD pipelines, and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
