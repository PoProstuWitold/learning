# HTML & CSS

## HTML

***[HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)*** - the standard markup language for creating and structuring web pages. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, HTML is the backbone of web content, defining the structure of a webpage through the use of elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. It works alongside CSS and JavaScript to create interactive, visually engaging websites.

### Characteristics
- Markup language, not a programming language
- Uses tags to define elements (e.g., <p>, <a>, <img>)
- Structured in a tree-like hierarchy with nested elements
- Supports embedding multimedia content like videos and audio
- Forms the skeleton of every webpage, defining layout and content
- Extensible with modern features like semantic HTML (e.g., <article>, <section>)
- Works in conjunction with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity
- Browser-rendered, meaning it’s interpreted directly by web browsers

## CSS

***[CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)*** - a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. Created by Håkon Wium Lie in 1996, CSS is responsible for the visual presentation of web pages, allowing developers to control layout, colors, fonts, and overall aesthetics. It works by applying styles to HTML elements, enabling responsive, visually appealing web designs.

### Characteristics
- Style sheet language that works alongside HTML
- Controls the layout, colors, fonts, and positioning of HTML elements
- Uses selectors and properties to target and style specific HTML elements
- Supports responsive design through media queries
- Allows for animations, transitions, and dynamic visual effects
- Cascading nature—styles can be inherited or overridden by more specific rules
- Can be embedded directly in HTML, internally in <style> tags, or externally through linked .css files
- Essential for creating mobile-friendly, visually appealing, and modern websites
