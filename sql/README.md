# Structured Query Language (SQL)

***[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)*** - a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in relational database management systems (RDBMS) or for stream processing in relational data stream management systems (RDSMS). Initially developed in the 1970s at IBM, SQL allows for querying, updating, and managing data in a structured format using tables. It is the standard language for interacting with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.

## Characteristics
- Declarative language focused on what to retrieve rather than how
- Based on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus
- Used for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in relational databases
- Strong support for transactional operations (ACID properties)
- Structured in terms of tables, rows, and columns
- Allows data manipulation (DML) and data definition (DDL) tasks
- Supports complex joins, subqueries, and aggregations
- Offers integrity constraints (primary keys, foreign keys) and indexing for data consistency and performance
- Vendor-specific dialects (e.g., T-SQL for Microsoft SQL Server, PL/SQL for Oracle)
- Extensive use in data-driven applications, from simple websites to large-scale data analytics platforms
