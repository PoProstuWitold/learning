# Go

***[Go (Golang)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))*** - a statically typed, compiled programming language created by Google in 2009. Designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, Go is known for its simplicity, speed, and strong support for concurrency, making it ideal for building efficient, scalable systems. Go was developed to handle large-scale network servers and distributed systems, which is why it’s popular in cloud computing, microservices, and DevOps.

## Characteristics
- Statically typed, compiled language
- Designed with simplicity in mind—minimalist syntax and structure
- Built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels
- Fast compilation and execution
- Strong garbage collection and memory management
- Cross-platform and open-source
- Efficient performance, ideal for systems programming
- Rich standard library, especially for networking, HTTP, and I/O operations
- No inheritance or complex object-oriented features (favors composition over inheritance)
- Excellent tooling (e.g. go fmt, go test, go mod)
