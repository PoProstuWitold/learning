# C & C++

## C

***[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))*** - a structured programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1973 at Bell Laboratories. It is one of the most popular computer languages today because of its structure, high-level abstraction, and machine-independent feature. C language was developed with UNIX operating system, so it is strongly associated with UNIX, which is one of the most popular network operating systems in use today and the heart of the internet data superhighway.

### Characteristics
- Small size
- Extensive use of function calls
- Loose typing - unlike PASCAL
- Structured language
- Low level (BitWise) programming is readily available
- Pointer implementation - extensive use of pointers for memory, array, structures, and functions.
- High-level constructs.
- Can handle low-level activities.
- Produces efficient programs.
- Can be compiled on a variety of computers.

## C++

[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) - an upgraded version of C programming. The main idea behind creating C++ programming was to add object orientation to the C programming language. The major upgradations are object-oriented programming methodology, namespace feature, operator overloading, error & exception handling.

### Characteristics
- Object-oriented
- Platform-dependent
- Mid-level programming language
- Structured programming language
- Rich library
- Memory management
- Powerful & fast 
- Pointers
- Compiler based
- Syntax based language
