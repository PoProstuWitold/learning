# Git

***[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)*** - a distributed version control system (VCS) created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git is used for tracking changes in source code during software development, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work. It’s the most popular version control system today, serving as the foundation for platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

## Characteristics
- Distributed version control, meaning each developer has a full copy of the project’s history
- Tracks changes in files over time with commit history
- Supports branching and merging, allowing parallel development and easy integration of changes
- Enables collaborative work on the same project without conflicts
- Fast and efficient, even for large projects
- Provides powerful tools for resolving conflicts and rolling back changes
- Works with remote repositories (e.g. GitHub, GitLab) for sharing code across teams
- Lightweight and flexible, supporting workflows like GitFlow, trunk-based development, and more
- Secure and reliable with strong safeguards against corruption or accidental data loss
