# Swift

***[Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language))*** - a powerful and intuitive programming language developed by Apple in 2014 for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS app development. Designed to be fast, safe, and expressive, Swift is built to work alongside Apple's Objective-C while introducing modern language features that make development easier and less error-prone. It is open-source and has gained popularity for building mobile and desktop applications.

## Characteristics
- Statically typed, compiled language with type inference
- Strong emphasis on safety, including automatic memory management and optionals to prevent null pointer exceptions
- Modern syntax with clean and expressive code
- Supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms
- Closely integrated with Apple’s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks
- High performance due to optimizations for speed and efficiency
- Playgrounds feature enables quick testing and learning with interactive code execution
- Excellent error handling with try-catch and optional chaining
- Interoperable with Objective-C, allowing legacy code integration
- Backed by Apple and the growing Swift open-source community
