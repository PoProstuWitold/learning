# JavaScript & TypeScript

## JavaScript

***[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)*** - a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to websites. Created by Brendan Eich in 1995, it has grown into one of the core technologies of the web alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript is a versatile language, now used beyond the browser environment thanks to Node.js, enabling back-end development.

### Characteristics
- Dynamically typed
- Prototype-based object orientation
- Interpreted language (runs in the browser or with Node.js)
- Asynchronous programming support with callbacks, promises, and async/await
- Weak typing (type coercion happens automatically)
- Runs on every major web browser
- Event-driven and non-blocking (especially in Node.js)
- Extensive ecosystem with libraries (React, Vue, etc.) and frameworks (Express, Angular, etc.)
- Highly versatile: can be used for front-end, back-end, mobile, and desktop development

## TypeScript

***[TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript)*** - a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft in 2012. It adds optional static typing and other powerful features to JavaScript, enabling developers to catch errors at compile time and write more robust, scalable applications. TypeScript compiles down to plain JavaScript, making it compatible with all environments that support JavaScript.

### Characteristics
- Strongly typed (optional static typing)
- Superset of JavaScriptâ€”everything in JavaScript works in TypeScript
- Compile-time error checking
- Supports modern JavaScript features (ES6+)
- IDE support with better code completion, refactoring, and debugging
- Can be compiled to various versions of JavaScript (ES5, ES6)
- Supports interfaces, generics, and decorators for more structured code
- Ideal for large-scale applications and enterprise-level projects
- Backed by a large community and strong integration with popular frameworks
